You work remotely for a US company, but English still feels like a barrier in your daily communication. DevLingo was built specifically for developers like you.

Unlike generic language apps, DevLingo teaches the exact phrases and expressions you use every day in remote tech work. No fluff, no tourist vocabulary, no restaurant dialogues. Just the English that actually matters for your career.


WHY DEVLINGO?

You already know how to code. You already have the technical skills. What's missing is the confidence to communicate clearly in English at work. DevLingo fills that gap with content that is 100% focused on the developer world.


WHAT YOU WILL LEARN

Over 3,600 phrases organized into 12 practical categories from your professional routine:

- Daily Standup: Communicate your progress, blockers, and plans with clarity.
- Code Review: Give and receive technical feedback professionally.
- Slack & Messaging: Master async communication that is informal yet clear.
- Professional Email: Write emails that are polite, clear, and to the point.
- Meetings: Actively participate in calls, planning, and retrospectives.
- Technical Discussions: Argue about architecture, trade-offs, and decisions.
- Pull Requests: Describe, comment on, and approve PRs with the right vocabulary.
- Bug Reports: Report and discuss bugs with technical precision.
- Pair Programming: Collaborate in real time with fluency.
- Interviews: Prepare for technical interviews in English with confidence.
- Casual Chat: Join your team's water cooler conversations naturally.
- Documentation: Write docs, READMEs, and specs like a native speaker.


HOW IT WORKS

10 new phrases per day. Simple, consistent, and never overwhelming. Each phrase comes with real-world context, pronunciation guidance, and practical examples. In just a few minutes a day, you build a solid and functional vocabulary.


HOME SCREEN WIDGET

Add the DevLingo widget to your iPhone home screen and see the phrase of the day without even opening the app. A lightweight, constant way to keep learning during your workday.


STREAK SYSTEM

Maintain your streak of consecutive days and track your progress over time. Think of it like your GitHub contribution graph: consistency builds results. Don't break the chain.


10 SOURCE LANGUAGES

DevLingo is available for speakers of Portuguese, Spanish, Mandarin, Hindi, Japanese, Korean, French, German, Italian, and Polish. No matter where you are from — if you work in tech, DevLingo is for you.
